      "Markets in 'last leg of normalization process': Strategist\n",
      "The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) closed in the red on Friday following the release of the August Jobs report, which fell short of economists' expectations. Fort Pitt Capital Group chief investment officer Dan Eye joins Market Domination to share his market outlook in light of this development. Eye observes that a \"wall of worry\" had formed after the August lows, suggesting that Friday's sell-off was likely due to markets climbing that wall \"a bit too fast.\" However, he reassured investors by stating, \"this is the last leg of the normalization process,\" advising them to remain calm and not be overly concerned. Looking ahead, Eye predicts that as this period passes and earnings growth continues, \"Assuming that the economy holds up, we expect that to carry into 2025 as well and create a pretty solid backdrop for the broad market and well-diversified portfolios.\" Regarding future earnings, Eye anticipates growth will extend beyond the tech sector. He highlights healthcare and industrials as areas that are \"recovering.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

      "Investors shouldn't 'reach too far for risk': Strategist\n",
      "While contending with September's seasonal volatility, stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) slide further in Friday's session in response to the August jobs data released this morning. While nonfarm payroll jobs growth came below economist expectations, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%. All of these factors are colliding with losses seen in the AI chip trade as semiconductor manufacturers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) failed to wow Wall Street with their earnings beats. John Hancock Investment Management co-chief investment strategist Emily Roland sits down with the Market Domination team to discuss which sectors investors can find more quality trades in while avoiding risk. \"The poster child for quality is mega-cap tech. We like that, but we do have a valuation issue there with the tech sector bumping up towards 30-times forward earnings,\" Roland explains. \"So we want to look at other areas of the market quality at a reasonable price, if you will. So looking at sectors like healthcare, which are trading at a 10% discount to the broad market...\" Roland weighs in on Big Tech stocks, the AI trade, and the bond market (^TYX, ^TNX, ^FVX) ahead of the Federal Reserve's plans to cut interest rates.

      "Economic worries back on Wall Street's radar after jobs data\n",
      "NEW YORK (Reuters) -Uncertainty over the U.S. economy's health is rippling through markets, adding fuel to an already-volatile period that has investors grappling with a shift in Federal Reserve policy, a tight U.S. election and worries over stretched valuations. U.S. stocks tumbled on Friday after closely watched jobs data showed labor market momentum slowing more than expected, suggesting a narrower path for the U.S. to achieve a soft landing, in which the Fed is able to cool inflation without badly damaging economic growth. The Fed is expected to cut interest rates at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, but the data revived fears that months of elevated borrowing costs have already started to pressure the economy.\n",

      "August jobs report, chip stocks under pressure: Morning Brief\n",
      "On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Brad Smith and Madison Mills break down the market's reaction to August's critical jobs report and the rocky road for the chip sector. The August jobs report saw 142,000 nonfarm payroll jobs added to the labor market, coming in below economist expectations of 165,000. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate came in line with estimates, falling to 4.2% from 4.3% in July. Acting US Labor Secretary Julie Su joins Yahoo Finance senior reporter Jennifer Schonberger, who finds cooling labor growth to be \"part of the transition from the breakneck speed of job growth that we saw in the initial years of the recovery.\" She adds, \"It's a... labor market that remains very strong... by all indications, especially when you combine it with our strong GDP growth, the battle against inflation, the labor force participation. Again, women in the labor force broke the last record which we set, which was in May,\" Su says. \"Overall, the indicators of the economy are of strong, robust growth and not recession.\" NatWest Head of US Michelle Girard believes that the jobs print \"won't push anybody off their prior position.\" She notes this report supports those looking for a 25 basis-point cut because it signals continued resilience, while also supporting the 50 basis-point cut due to \"downward revisions.\" She questions, \"Did it really come down to this one report, to be honest, for the Fed?\" She emphasizes the Fed's intense focus on inflation, with the main concern being that they hit the 2% inflation target. However, she notes there has been \"enough evidence\" to show that inflation is trending downward, so the focus now shifts to the economy. NYSE Senior Market Strategist Michael Reinking reiterates the notion that August's jobs print did not solidify either a 25- or 50-basis-point cut, calling it \"a coin flip.\" He points out improvements in the headline payrolls number, but suggests that downward revisions from July offset the positive outlook. Regarding the unemployment rate, he comments that \"the bar was very low.\" \"Unfortunately, I don't think it gives you a definitive answer from a Federal Reserve perspective. There's a lot of would've, could've, should've,\" Reinking adds. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) are under pressure after its lackluster sales forecast for the fourth quarter overshadowed its earnings beat. The Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman digs into the chip company's earnings and its overall outlook amid a heated AI race. \"Clearly, the Street wasn't happy. They were looking for some sort of outsized number... But this is a little more of a story about the diversification of the business as well. So the AI business is performing. You're going to have some complicated networking that Broadcom is going to help solve. And of course, these accelerators, these AI processors, Broadcom is in the driver's seat. They have won some really important designs,\" Newman tells Yahoo Finance. This post was written by Melanie Riehl\n",

      "The August jobs report came in weaker than expected, adding 142,000 jobs versus the 165,000 economists had anticipated. Wells Fargo Investment Institute Global Market Strategist Gary Schlossberg joins Morning Brief to discuss his economic outlook following this report. Schlossberg notes that currently there is \"no smoking gun\" to determine the size of the Federal Reserve's rate cut based on this jobs report, although he believes \"we're still on track for a soft landing.\" However, he emphasizes that more data is needed and he wouldn't \"rule out a recession at this point.\" \"For now at least there are clear indications that the market is softening around the edges. Job openings have been declining... The underemployment numbers seem to reflect a reluctance to outright lay workers off. So all this to us points to a shallow employment cycle as we go through what we think will be a soft landing,\" Schlossberg told Yahoo Finance.

      "Labor market is not 'falling off a cliff', Fed to cut 25bps : Economist\n",
      "The August jobs report fell short of expectations, adding 142,000 jobs compared to the 165,000 economists had forecast. EY Senior Economist Lydia Boussour joins Wealth! to discuss her economic outlook in light of this report. Boussour observes that while the jobs data indicates a softening labor market, it's not \"falling off a cliff.\" She notes that the absence of broad deterioration in the labor market makes a 50 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve unlikely. \"In terms of the size of the rate cuts, we remain in the camp that the Federal Reserve will implement a 25 basis point rate cut and will opt for that gradual approach with a steady pace of decreases throughout the remainder of the year,\" she tells Yahoo Finance, projecting a total of 125 basis points in cuts for 2025. Regarding inflation, Boussour highlights the continued progress and the disinflationary trend. She emphasizes, \"So really the focus right now is more on the labor market.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth!

      "Size of Fed rate cut 'a coin flip': Strategist\n",
      "The August jobs report fell short of economist expectations, adding only 142,000 jobs versus the anticipated 165,000. NYSE Senior Market Strategist Michael Reinking joins Morning Brief to discuss his outlook following the report. Reinking notes that today's jobs print did not solidify either a 25 or 50 basis point cut, calling it \"a coin flip.\" He points out improvements in the headline payrolls number, but suggests that downward revisions from July offset the positive outlook. Regarding the unemployment rate, he comments that \"the bar was very low.\" \"Unfortunately, I don't think it gives you a definitive answer from a Federal Reserve perspective. There's a lot of would've, could've, should've,\" Reinking told Yahoo Finance, though he personally believes a 25 basis point cut will materialize. As for market outlooks, Reinking suggests it's harder to say that easing monetary policy will significantly impact markets. He notes, \"We're not getting a clear signal from the markets\" right now.

      "The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) closed in the red on Friday following the release of the August Jobs report, which fell short of economists' expectations. Fort Pitt Capital Group chief investment officer Dan Eye joins Market Domination to share his market outlook in light of this development. Eye observes that a \"wall of worry\" had formed after the August lows, suggesting that Friday's sell-off was likely due to markets climbing that wall \"a bit too fast.\" However, he reassured investors by stating, \"this is the last leg of the normalization process,\" advising them to remain calm and not be overly concerned. Looking ahead, Eye predicts that as this period passes and earnings growth continues, \"Assuming that the economy holds up, we expect that to carry into 2025 as well and create a pretty solid backdrop for the broad market and well-diversified portfolios.\" Regarding future earnings, Eye anticipates growth will extend beyond the tech sector. He highlights healthcare and industrials as areas that are \"recovering.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

John Hancock Investment Management co-chief investment strategist Emily Roland sits down with the Market Domination team to discuss which sectors investors can find more quality trades in while avoiding risk. \"The poster child for quality is mega-cap tech. We like that, but we do have a valuation issue there with the tech sector bumping up towards 30-times forward earnings,\" Roland explains. \"So we want to look at other areas of the market quality at a reasonable price, if you will.

      "NEW YORK (Reuters) -Uncertainty over the U.S. economy's health is rippling through markets, adding fuel to an already-volatile period that has investors grappling with a shift in Federal Reserve policy, a tight U.S. election and worries over stretched valuations. U.S. stocks tumbled on Friday after closely watched jobs data showed labor market momentum slowing more than expected, suggesting a narrower path for the U.S. to achieve a soft landing, in which the Fed is able to cool inflation without badly damaging economic growth. The Fed is expected to cut interest rates at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, but the data revived fears that months of elevated borrowing costs have already started to pressure the economy.\n",

      "August jobs report, chip stocks under pressure: Morning Brief\n",
      "On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Brad Smith and Madison Mills break down the market's reaction to August's critical jobs report and the rocky road for the chip sector. The August jobs report saw 142,000 nonfarm payroll jobs added to the labor market, coming in below economist expectations of 165,000. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate came in line with estimates, falling to 4.2% from 4.3% in July. Acting US Labor Secretary Julie Su joins Yahoo Finance senior reporter Jennifer Schonberger, who finds cooling labor growth to be \"part of the transition from the breakneck speed of job growth that we saw in the initial years of the recovery.\" She adds, \"It's a... labor market that remains very strong... by all indications, especially when you combine it with our strong GDP growth, the battle against inflation, the labor force participation. Again, women in the labor force broke the last record which we set, which was in May,\" Su says. \"Overall, the indicators of the economy are of strong, robust growth and not recession.\" NatWest Head of US Michelle Girard believes that the jobs print \"won't push anybody off their prior position.\" She notes this report supports those looking for a 25 basis-point cut because it signals continued resilience, while also supporting the 50 basis-point cut due to \"downward revisions.\" She questions, \"Did it really come down to this one report, to be honest, for the Fed?\" She emphasizes the Fed's intense focus on inflation, with the main concern being that they hit the 2% inflation target. However, she notes there has been \"enough evidence\" to show that inflation is trending downward, so the focus now shifts to the economy. NYSE Senior Market Strategist Michael Reinking reiterates the notion that August's jobs print did not solidify either a 25- or 50-basis-point cut, calling it \"a coin flip.\" He points out improvements in the headline payrolls number, but suggests that downward revisions from July offset the positive outlook. Regarding the unemployment rate, he comments that \"the bar was very low.\" \"Unfortunately, I don't think it gives you a definitive answer from a Federal Reserve perspective. There's a lot of would've, could've, should've,\" Reinking adds. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) are under pressure after its lackluster sales forecast for the fourth quarter overshadowed its earnings beat. The Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman digs into the chip company's earnings and its overall outlook amid a heated AI race. \"Clearly, the Street wasn't happy. They were looking for some sort of outsized number... But this is a little more of a story about the diversification of the business as well. So the AI business is performing. You're going to have some complicated networking that Broadcom is going to help solve. And of course, these accelerators, these AI processors, Broadcom is in the driver's seat. They have won some really important designs,\" Newman tells Yahoo Finance. This post was written by Melanie Riehl\n",

Wells Fargo Investment Institute Global Market Strategist Gary Schlossberg joins Morning Brief to discuss his economic outlook following this report. Schlossberg notes that currently there is \"no smoking gun\" to determine the size of the Federal Reserve's rate cut based on this jobs report, although he believes \"we're still on track for a soft landing.\" However, he emphasizes that more data is needed and he wouldn't \"rule out a recession at this point.\" \"For now at least there are clear indications that the market is softening around the edges. Job openings have been declining... The underemployment numbers seem to reflect a reluctance to outright lay workers off. So all this to us points to a shallow employment cycle as we go through what we think will be a soft landing,\" Schlossberg told Yahoo Finance.

EY Senior Economist Lydia Boussour joins Wealth! to discuss her economic outlook in light of this report. Boussour observes that while the jobs data indicates a softening labor market, it's not \"falling off a cliff.\" She notes that the absence of broad deterioration in the labor market makes a 50 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve unlikely. \"In terms of the size of the rate cuts, we remain in the camp that the Federal Reserve will implement a 25 basis point rate cut and will opt for that gradual approach with a steady pace of decreases throughout the remainder of the year,\" she tells Yahoo Finance, projecting a total of 125 basis points in cuts for 2025. Regarding inflation, Boussour highlights the continued progress and the disinflationary trend. She emphasizes, \"So really the focus right now is more on the labor market.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth!

      "August jobs report, Fed blackout, Broadcom: 3 Things\n",
      "US stock futures (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are reacting to the August jobs report, which saw 142,000 nonfarm payroll jobs added to the labor market, below economist expectations of 165,000. The unemployment rate was in line with US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates, falling to 4.2% from 4.3% in July. The Federal Reserve is digesting August's labor print as officials enter their \"blackout period\" ahead of the central bank's September meeting in two weeks. Shares of chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) tumble further as the stock trades in negative territory in extended hours over its disappointing revenue guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter.

      "STORY: U.S. employment increased less than expected in August, but a drop in the jobless rate to 4.2% suggested an orderly labor market slowdown continued and probably did not warrant a big interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve this month. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 142,000 jobs last month after a downwardly revised 89,000 rise in July, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday. Markets expectations for an upsized 50 basis point cut at the Federal Reserve's mid-September meeting increased after the data.\n",

Broadcom, Nvidia and other tech companies drove the market lower amid ongoing concerns that their prices soared too high in the boom around artificial intelligence, and they dragged the Nasdaq composite down by a market-leading 2.6%. Sharp swings also hit the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled, recovered and then fell again after the jobs report showed U.S. employers hired fewer workers in August than economists expected.\n",

      "August jobs data won't be enough to 'force the Fed's hand'\n",
      "Markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are anticipating the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates in mid-September, with opinions divided between a 50 and 25 basis point reduction. PNC Asset Management Group CIO Amanda Agati joins Market Domination to discuss market outlooks ahead of the increasingly crucial August jobs report to be released Friday morning, which could influence the Fed's decision. Agati notes that data \"naturally comes in very mixed\" as markets approach a cutting cycle. She maintains that markets are \"still very much in a soft landing camp,\" and no data so far has indicated a need for a 50 basis point cut in September. Agati believes a 25 basis point cut will suffice to boost the economy. Regarding stock markets and investing strategies amid market uncertainty, Agati tells Yahoo Finance: \"This market is priced to perfection, and so there are pockets of opportunity. We're very much leaning into quality, on both the equity and fixed income side of the equation. Not everything has rallied to the extent of the Magnificent Seven, so there are pockets of opportunity. It's not a market where you want to sit on the sidelines with a ton of cash here. But it is hard to make really big practical moves ahead of some of the key news items that I think are coming over the next few months.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

      "On today's episode of Catalysts, Hosts Brad Smith and Madison Mills break down some of the biggest stories of the trading day, from fresh economic data to the tumultuous week for the auto industry. The services sector expanded in August, according to the latest ISM Services PMI data. The reading was 51.5, just slightly higher than Wall Street's expectation and July's reading of 51.4. Meanwhile, 99,000 private payroll jobs were added to the US labor market in August, according to ADP. This figure came in well below original forecasts of 145,000 jobs. Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods emphasizes the importance of economic data leading into the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting in two weeks. As the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release August jobs data on Friday, Woods calls the print \"the biggest unemployment report we've had since the last one, obviously, which came two days after the Fed meeting.\" It's been a rocky week for the auto industry as General Motors (GM) was downgraded by Wolfe Research, Volkswagen (VOW3.DE, VWAGY, VOW.DE, VWAPY) is considering shuttering some of its plants, and Tesla (TSLA) announced plans to release its Full Self-Driving technology in China and Europe in the first quarter of 2025. Autoblog editor-in-chief Greg Migliore explains that amid the wave of negative news for the industry, Tesla was rewarded for not making any drastic moves. Tuesday marked one of the biggest sales of high-grade corporate bonds, amounting to $43.3 billion. S&P Global Ratings global head of private markets analytics Ruth Yang joins the Catalysts team in-studio to discuss the credit market outlook as the Federal Reserve begins its rate easing cycle. \"We're looking for the rates to drop by about 150 basis points over the next 15 months. So the world is kind of starting to say, 'OK, we've got inflation under control. Things are getting better. Credit is settled in higher for longer. And now is the opportunity to kind of refinance and get the wheels really back in motion,'\" Yang tells Yahoo Finance. This post was written by Melanie Riehl\n",

      "It's 'premature' to think soft landing is secured: Strategist\n",
      "Investors are moving to defensive corners of the market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) on Thursday as fresh data sparked some concerns of too much weakness in the labor market. SoFi head of investment strategy Liz Young Thomas joins Morning Brief to discuss the market's reaction to the data and how investors can best position their portfolios as the Federal Reserve begins its rate-easing cycle. Thomas notes that \"equities are still cheering for the beginning of this rate-cutting cycle\" as the Fed eyes a soft landing. She explains that easing rates will likely benefit cyclical areas of the market, like small caps (^RUT), financials (XLF), real estate (XLRE), and industrials (XLI). However, she warns that \"it would be premature to assume that we have secured a soft landing.\" Investors should still have some exposure to areas of the market that benefit from a steepening yield curve. Thomas points to gold (GC=F) as a good option as the global currency is experiencing volatility. As all eyes are on Friday's August jobs report, Thomas believes that if the data comes in cooler than expected, the market will react negatively and will likely experience a sell-off of mega-cap names. She adds that utilities are \"not just a purely defensive play\" at this stage, as they are a beneficiary of the AI trade. In addition, she explains that consumer staples (XLP) — another traditional defensive play — are overbought currently. If economic data continues to cool during the Fed's cutting cycle, she expects financials and real estate to continue to slow.

      "Unemployment could spark 50bps cut and 'panic move' by Fed\n",
      "ISM's Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) saw the sector grow in August, according to a print of 51.5 which was above expectations for 51.4. \"We're putting every data point under a microscope,\" Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods tells Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Catalysts, emphasizing the importance of economic data leading into the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting in two weeks. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release August jobs data tomorrow morning, which is projected to be a major influence in how the Fed cuts interest rates in the remaining months of 2024. \"Friday is the biggest unemployment report we've had since the last one, obviously, which came two days after the Fed meeting. And what we learned after that meeting was: One, the Fed didn't really know the data because it came in hot. We were expecting 4.1%, we got 4.3%,\" Woods says. \"Tomorrow, 4.2%. Anything hotter than that? Then this market could take that leg lower and then we could be talking about 50 basis points and a possible panic move by the Fed.\" Woods weighs in on the deluge of market events in recent weeks, from the Japanese yen carry trade to spiking volatility (^VIX), that have been bearing down on equities (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC).
